# Computer-Vision-using-OpenCV
This covers the basic functions of OpenCV library with the help of some programs like object detection using colour masking and Virtual Background
To run the basic program on how OpenCV works, and how it diffeentiate colors, run:
*python col_trackbar.py*
To create a virtual background on your live image, run:
*python virtual_background.py*
To capture an image using a timer, run:
*python camera_timer.py*
To see the real time on the image, run:
